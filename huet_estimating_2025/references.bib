	abstract = {Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The food system’s negative impact on biodiversity is increasing over time. Conserving biodiversity requires immediate and widespread action to reduce the biodiversity footprint of food consumption, but biodiversity has historically been neglected in sustainability assessments. We combine high-resolution estimates of the biodiversity footprint with food system scenario modeling to predict the consequences of two key food system sustainability actions in the United States: diet shifts and food waste reduction. Taking these actions may benefit biodiversity in some places and harm it in others. The results of this study can help decision makers understand the trade-offs we must navigate to balance human health, economics, and environmental sustainability and help consumers understand how their diets and food waste behaviors influence global biodiversity.
          , 
            Diet shifts and food waste reduction have the potential to reduce the land and biodiversity footprint of the food system. In this study, we estimated the amount of land used to produce food consumed in the United States and the number of species threatened with extinction as a result of that land use. We predicted potential changes to the biodiversity threat under scenarios of food waste reduction and shifts to recommended healthy and sustainable diets. Domestically produced beef and dairy, which require vast land areas, and imported fruit, which has an intense impact on biodiversity per unit land, have especially high biodiversity footprints. Adopting the Planetary Health diet or the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)–recommended vegetarian diet nationwide would reduce the biodiversity footprint of food consumption. However, increases in the consumption of foods grown in global biodiversity hotspots both inside and outside the United States, especially fruits and vegetables, would partially offset the reduction. In contrast, the USDA-recommended US-style and Mediterranean-style diets would increase the biodiversity threat due to increased consumption of dairy and farmed fish. Simply halving food waste would benefit global biodiversity more than half as much as all Americans simultaneously shifting to a sustainable diet. Combining food waste reduction with the adoption of a sustainable diet could reduce the biodiversity footprint of US food consumption by roughly half. Species facing extinction because of unsustainable food consumption practices could be rescued by reducing agriculture's footprint; diet shifts and food waste reduction can help us get there.},

	abstract = {In this article, the authors propose an impact assessment method for life cycle assessment (LCA) that adheres to established LCA principles for land use-related impact assessment, bridges current research gaps and addresses the requirements of different stakeholders for a methodological framework. The conservation of biodiversity is a priority for humanity, as expressed in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Addressing biodiversity across value chains is a key challenge for enabling sustainable production pathways. Life cycle assessment is a standardised approach to assess and compare environmental impacts of products along their value chains. The impact assessment method presented in this article allows the quantification of the impact of land-using production processes on biodiversity for several broad land use classes. It provides a calculation framework with degrees of customisation (e.g., to take into account regional conservation priorities), but also offers a default valuation of biodiversity based on naturalness. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through an example of a consumer product. The main strength of the approach is that it yields highly aggregated information on the biodiversity impacts of products, enabling biodiversity-conscious decisions about raw materials, production routes and end user products.},

	abstract = {Food security and biodiversity conservation are closely interconnected challenges to be addressed to achieve a sustainable food system on a global scale. Due to the complex nature of food production and consumption system, quantifying the impacts of food supply chains on biodiversity is challenging. Life cycle assessment (LCA) allows for systematically addressing environmental impacts along supply chains, representing a reference methodology that can be applied for assessing food systems. In the present study, 32 representative food products of consumption in the European Union (EU) were selected and their environmental impacts calculated through a process-based LCA. The potential contribution of EU food consumption to the current biodiversity decline has been evaluated adopting both midpoint and endpoint indicators. A comparison of the impact drivers was performed. Meat products, the underpinning land use for agricultural purposes, and climate change represent the main hotspots of impacts on biodiversity. Notwithstanding several drivers of biodiversity loss can be accounted for with LCA, the evidence of the increasing biodiversity decline on both a European and a global scale indicates that the assessment system should be further expanded, especially for what concerns refining impact categories such as ecotoxicity, and including resource overexploitation, and impact due to invasive species. This study illustrates: how far the current LCA based impact assessment framework may help to address the drivers of biodiversity loss; which are the main uncertainties associated to results stemming from the application of different endpoint methods; which aspects need to be elaborated further to ensure a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity impacts due to food production and consumption.},

This report describes the EF3.1 update, clarifies the differences between the EF3.0 and the EF3.1, and explains which changes mainly drove the variation of results in case of the EF representative products and of the official EF datasets. The update of the characterisation factors was major (i.e., involving the CFs derivation/calculation rules) in the case of Climate change, Human toxicity, non-cancer, and Ecotoxicity, freshwater, while it only included minor adjustments for other three impact categories (Acidification, Photochemical ozone formation, and Human toxicity, cancer). The change in the normalisation factors was due both to the update of the characterisation factors and to the correction of the global inventory of very few substances. Finally, the EF3.1 results of 2752 EF official datasets and 49 EF representative products were compared to the EF3.0 results},

	abstract = {Following the Paris agreement in 2015, the European Union (EU) set a carbon neutrality objective by 2050, and so did France. The French agricultural sector can contribute as a carbon sink through carbon storage in biomass and soil, in addition to reducing GHG emissions. The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the additional storage potential and cost of a set of eight carbon-storing practices. The impacts of these agricultural practices on soil organic carbon storage and crop production are assessed at a very fine spatial scale, using crop and grassland models. The associated area base, GHG budget, and implementation costs are assessed and aggregated at the region level. The economic model BANCO uses this information to derive the marginal abatement cost curve for France and identify the combination of carbon storing practices that minimizes the total cost of achieving a given national net GHG mitigation target. We find that a substantial amount of carbon, 36.2 to 52.9 MtCO2e yr−1, can be stored in soil and biomass for reasonable carbon prices of 55 and 250 € tCO2e−1, respectively (corresponding to current and 2030 French carbon value for climate action), mainly by developing agroforestry and hedges, generalising cover crops, and introducing or extending temporary grasslands in crop sequences. This finding questions the 3–5 times lower target of 10 MtCO2e.yr−1 retained for the agricultural carbon sink by the French climate neutrality strategy. Overall, this would decrease total French GHG emissions by 9.2–13.8\%, respectively (reference year 2019).},

	abstract = {To promote food security and sustainability, ecologically intensive farming systems should reliably produce adequate yields of high-quality food, enhance the environment, be profitable, and promote social wellbeing. Yet, while many studies address the mean effects of ecologically intensive farming systems on sustainability metrics, few have considered variability. This represents a knowledge gap because producers depend on reliable provisioning of yields, profits, and environmental services to enhance the sustainability of their production systems over time. Further, stable crop yields are necessary to ensure reliable access to nutritious foods. Here we address this by conducting a global meta-analysis to assess the average magnitude and variability of seven sustainability metrics in organic compared to conventional systems. Specifically, we explored the effects of these systems on (i) biotic abundance, (ii) biotic richness, (iii) soil organic carbon, (iv) soil carbon stocks, (v) crop yield, (vi) total production costs, and (vii) profitability. Organic farms promoted biotic abundance, biotic richness, soil carbon, and profitability, but conventional farms produced higher yields. Compared to conventional farms, organic farms had lower variability in abundance and richness but greater yield variability. Organic farms thus provided a “win-win” (high means and low variability) for environmental sustainability, while conventional farms provided a “win-win” for production by promoting high crop yields with low variability. Despite lower yields, and greater yield variability, organic systems had similar costs to conventional systems and were more profitable due to organic premiums. Our results suggest certification guidelines for organic farms successfully promote reliable environmental benefits, but greater reliance on ecological processes may reduce predictability of crop production.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organic food consumption has steadily increased over the past decade in westernized countries.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, based on observational data, was to compare some sustainability features of diets from consumers with varying levels of organic food.
METHODS: The diet sustainability among 29,210 participants of the NutriNet-Santé study was estimated using databases developed within the BioNutriNet project. Four dimensions (nutrition, environment, economy, and toxicology) of diet sustainability were assessed using: 1) nutritional indicators through dietary intakes and dietary scores, and BMI; 2) environmental indicators (greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative energy demand, and land occupation); 3) economic indicators via diet monetary costs; and 4) estimated daily food exposures to 15 pesticides. Adjusted means (95\% CI) across weighted quintiles of organic food consumption in the diet were estimated via ANCOVA. Breakdown methods were used to disentangle the contribution of the production system (organic compared with conventional) from the dietary pattern in the variation of diet-related environmental impacts, monetary costs, and pesticide exposure, between the 2 extreme quintiles.
RESULTS: Higher organic food consumption was associated with higher plant-food and lower animal-food consumption, overall nutritional quality (higher dietary scores), and lower BMI. Diet-related greenhouse-gas emissions, cumulative energy demand, and land occupation gradually decreased with increasing organic food consumption, whereas total diet monetary cost increased. Diet exposure to most pesticides decreased across quintiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Diets of high organic food consumers were generally characterized by strong nutritional and environmental benefits. The latter were mostly driven by the low consumption of animal-based foods, whereas the production system was responsible for the higher diet monetary costs, and the overall reduced dietary pesticide exposure.},

            The European Union (EU) food market is characterised by the presence of several front-of-pack nutrition labels (FOPLs), some of which have only been introduced lately. While the EU Commission proposed to harmonise and possibly mandate the use of FOPLs, agreement on which label to adopt has not been reached. This review explores the main issues related to the adoption of FOPLs from both the demand-side and the supply-side perspective with the aim of providing an updated evidence-based road map for the development of future studies that can contribute to extend scientific evidence and guide future food policies.},

However, CFs based on this approach are to date available for only six broad land use types without differentiating between their management intensities and have large uncertainties that limit their practical applicability. Here we derive updated CFs for projecting potential species losses of five taxa resulting from five broad land use types (managed forests, plantations, pasture, cropland, urban) under three intensity levels (minimal, light, and intense use) in each of the 804 terrestrial ecoregions. We utilize recent global land use intensity maps and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme to parametrize the SAR model. As a case study, we compare the biodiversity impacts of 1 m3 of wood produced under four different forest management regimes in India and demonstrate that the new land use intensity-specific CFs have smaller uncertainty intervals and are able to discern the impacts of intensively managed land uses from the low intensity regimes, which has not been possible through previous CFs.},

Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.},

	abstract = {Agricultural landscape homogenization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and key ecosystem services. Increasing agricultural landscape heterogeneity by increasing seminatural cover can help to mitigate biodiversity loss. However, the amount of seminatural cover is generally low and difficult to increase in many intensively managed agricultural landscapes. We hypothesized that increasing the heterogeneity of the crop mosaic itself (hereafter “crop heterogeneity”) can also have positive effects on biodiversity. In 8 contrasting regions of Europe and North America, we selected 435 landscapes along independent gradients of crop diversity and mean field size. Within each landscape, we selected 3 sampling sites in 1, 2, or 3 crop types. We sampled 7 taxa (plants, bees, butterflies, hoverflies, carabids, spiders, and birds) and calculated a synthetic index of multitrophic diversity at the landscape level. Increasing crop heterogeneity was more beneficial for multitrophic diversity than increasing seminatural cover. For instance, the effect of decreasing mean field size from 5 to 2.8 ha was as strong as the effect of increasing seminatural cover from 0.5 to 11\%. Decreasing mean field size benefited multitrophic diversity even in the absence of seminatural vegetation between fields. Increasing the number of crop types sampled had a positive effect on landscape-level multitrophic diversity. However, the effect of increasing crop diversity in the landscape surrounding fields sampled depended on the amount of seminatural cover. Our study provides large-scale, multitrophic, cross-regional evidence that increasing crop heterogeneity can be an effective way to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes without taking land out of agricultural production.},

	abstract = {The benefits of organic farming to biodiversity in agricultural landscapes continue to be hotly debated, emphasizing the importance of precisely quantifying the effect of organic vs. conventional farming. We conducted an updated hierarchical meta-analysis of studies that compared biodiversity under organic and conventional farming methods, measured as species richness. We calculated effect sizes for 184 observations garnered from 94 studies, and for each study, we obtained three standardized measures reflecting land-use intensity. We investigated the stability of effect sizes through time, publication bias due to the ‘file drawer’ problem, and consider whether the current literature is representative of global organic farming patterns. On average, organic farming increased species richness by about 30\%. This result has been robust over the last 30 years of published studies and shows no sign of diminishing. Organic farming had a greater effect on biodiversity as the percentage of the landscape consisting of arable fields increased, that is, it is higher in intensively farmed regions. The average effect size and the response to agricultural intensification depend on taxonomic group, functional group and crop type. There is some evidence for publication bias in the literature; however, our results are robust to its impact. Current studies are heavily biased towards northern and western Europe and North America, while other regions with large areas of organic farming remain poorly investigated. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis affirms that organic farming has large positive effects on biodiversity compared with conventional farming, but that the effect size varies with the organism group and crop studied, and is greater in landscapes with higher land-use intensity. Decisions about where to site organic farms to maximize biodiversity will, however, depend on the costs as well as the potential benefits. Current studies have been heavily biased towards agricultural systems in the developed world. We recommend that future studies pay greater attention to other regions, in particular, areas with tropical, subtropical and Mediterranean climates, in which very few studies have been conducted.},

Against pluralists, who hold that biodiversity consists of distinct but correlated properties of natural systems, I argue that the supposed correlations between these properties are not tight enough to warrant treating and measuring them as a bundle. I additionally argue that deflationary theories of biodiversity don’t go far enough, since a large proportion of what we value in the environment falls outside bounds of what could reasonably be called “diversity”. I suggest that in current scientific practice biodiversity is generally an unnecessary placeholder for biological value of all sorts, and that we are better off eliminating it from conservation biology, or at least drastically reducing its role.},

	abstract = {Farmland is a major land cover type in Europe and Africa and provides habitat for numerous species. The severe decline in farmland biodiversity of the last decades has been attributed to changes in farming practices, and organic and low-input farming are assumed to mitigate detrimental effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. Since the farm enterprise is the primary unit of agricultural decision making, management-related effects at the field scale need to be assessed at the farm level. Therefore, in this study, data were collected on habitat characteristics, vascular plant, earthworm, spider, and bee communities and on the corresponding agricultural management in 237 farms in 13 European and two African regions. In 15 environmental and agricultural homogeneous regions, 6–20 farms with the same farm type (e.g., arable crops, grassland, or specific permanent crops) were selected. If available, an equal number of organic and non-organic farms were randomly selected. Alternatively, farms were sampled along a gradient of management intensity. For all selected farms, the entire farmed area was mapped, which resulted in total in the mapping of 11 338 units attributed to 194 standardized habitat types, provided together with additional descriptors. On each farm, one site per available habitat type was randomly selected for species diversity investigations. Species were sampled on 2115 sites and identified to the species level by expert taxonomists. Species lists and abundance estimates are provided for each site and sampling date (one date for plants and earthworms, three dates for spiders and bees). In addition, farmers provided information about their management practices in face-to-face interviews following a standardized questionnaire. Farm management indicators for each farm are available (e.g., nitrogen input, pesticide applications, or energy input). Analyses revealed a positive effect of unproductive areas and a negative effect of intensive management on biodiversity. Communities of the four taxonomic groups strongly differed in their response to habitat characteristics, agricultural management, and regional circumstances. The data has potential for further insights into interactions of farmland biodiversity and agricultural management at site, farm, and regional scale.},

	abstract = {One of the critical challenges in agriculture is enhancing yield without compromising its foundation, a healthy environment and, particularly, soils. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify management practices that simultaneously support soil health and production and help achieve environmentally sound production systems. To investigate how management influences production and soil health under realistic agronomic conditions, we conducted an on-farm study involving 60 wheat fields managed conventionally, under no-till or organically. We assessed 68 variables defining management, production and soil health properties. We examined how management systems and individual practices describing crop diversification, fertiliser inputs, agrochemical use and soil disturbance influenced production—quantity and quality—and soil health focusing on aspects ranging from soil organic matter over soil structure to microbial abundance and diversity. Our on-farm comparison showed marked differences between soil health and production in the current system: organic management resulted in the best overall soil health (+47\%) but the most significant yield gap (−34\%) compared to conventional management. No-till systems were generally intermediate, exhibiting a smaller yield gap (−17\%) and only a marginally improved level of soil health (+5\%) compared to conventional management. Yet, the overlap between management systems in production and soil health properties was considerably large. Our results further highlight the importance of soil health for productivity by revealing positive associations between crop yield and soil health properties, particularly under conventional management, whereas factors such as weed pressure were more dominant in organic systems. None of the three systems showed advantages in supporting production-soil health-based multifunctionality. In contrast, a cross-system analysis suggests that multifunctional agroecosystems could be achieved through a combination of crop diversification and organic amendments with effective crop protection. Synthesis and applications: Our on-farm study implies that current trade-offs in managing production and soil health could be overcome through more balanced systems incorporating conventional and alternative approaches. Such multifunctionality supporting systems could unlock synergies between vital ecosystem services and help achieve productive yet environmentally sound agriculture supported by healthy soils.},

Investigating caeteris paribus drivers of performance, we conclude that synergies are rare. Investing in farming equipment, optimizing fuel use or suppressing manure composting can however improve environmental performance by 5 to 13\% without impairing profits. In parallel, increasing labor productivity and reducing the share of protein in the diet enhances the economic performance by 7 to 21\% without increasing GHG emissions. On the debated merit of intensiveness, our analysis leans towards a negative influence of concentrates, especially protein-rich ones such as soybean cakes, both on economic and environmental performances. This result, consistent with previous studies on extensive systems, could be conditioned by a good know-how and management of grass.},

Using propensity score weighting, we find that the carbon footprint of organic milk is 19\% (95\%CI = [10\%–28\%]) lower than its conventional counterpart without indirect land-use change and 11\% (95\%CI = [5\%–17\%]) lower with indirect land use changes.

              The carbon and land footprint of 26 certified food products – geographical indications and organic products and their conventional references are assessed. This assessment goes beyond existing literature by (1) designing a calculation method fit for the comparison between certified food and conventional production, (2) using the same calculation method and parameters for 52 products – 26 Food Quality Schemes and their reference products – to allow for a meaningful comparison, (3) transparently documenting this calculation method and opening access to the detailed results and the underlying data, and (4) providing the first assessment of the carbon and land footprint of geographical indications. The method used is Life Cycle Assessment, largely relying on the
              Cool Farm Tool
              for the impact assessment. The most common indicator of climate impact, the carbon footprint expressed per ton of product, is not significantly different between certified foods and their reference products. The only exception to this pattern are vegetal organic products, whose carbon footprint is 16\% lower. This is because the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from the absence of mineral fertilizers is never fully offset by the associated lower yield. The climate impact of certified food per hectare is however 26\% than their reference and their land footprint is logically 24\% higher. Technical specifications directly or indirectly inducing a lower use of mineral fertilizers are a key driver of this pattern. So is yield, which depends both on
              terroir
              and farming practices. Overall, this assessment reinforces the quality policy of the European Union: promoting certified food is not inconsistent with mitigating climate change.},

	abstract = {Organic farming supports higher biodiversity than conventional farming, but at the cost of lower yields. We conducted a meta-analysis quantifying the trade-off between biodiversity and yield, comparing conventional and organic farming. We developed a compatibility index to assess whether biodiversity gains from organic farming exceed yield losses, and a substitution index to assess whether organic farming would increase biodiversity in an area if maintaining total production under organic farming would require cultivating more land at the expense of nature. Overall, organic farming had 23\% gain in biodiversity with a similar cost of yield decline. Biodiversity gain is negatively correlated to yield loss for microbes and plants, but no correlation was found for other taxa. The biodiversity and yield trade-off varies under different contexts of organic farming. The overall compatibility index value was close to zero, with negative values for cereal crops, positive for non-cereal crops, and varies across taxa. Our results indicate that, on average, the proportion of biodiversity gain is similar to the proportion of yield loss for paired field studies. For some taxa in non-cereal crops, switching to organic farming can lead to a biodiversity gain without yield loss. We calculated the overall value of substitution index and further discussed the application of this index to evaluate when the biodiversity of less intensified farming system is advantageous.},

	title = {The {European} agro-economic model {AROPAj}},
	url = {https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04109872},
	abstract = {This publication presents the European agro-economic AROPAj model. Throughout recent years the model has been adapted to suit FADN data and the expansion of the European Union (EU ). The revised model, which is presented here, is based on the same principles, modularity, and generic conceptions of the previous renditions. The strength of the model lies in the evolution of computing capacities and facilities, especially when new scientific problems arise. The starting premise of the model resulted from the combination of different factors, namely new policy tools announced to be implemented by the changing Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the need to account for a wide diversity of farming systems, and the changing geographical area following the EU enlargement. In complement of econometric approaches relying on past information, the model introduces new mathematical programming (MP) approaches using the most relevant data. The Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN ) is considered as a permanent, robust and representative source of information, useful for MP models delineated at the farm level. The information in the FADN database consists of surveys of individual farm samples. The database provides individual information mainly accounting of accountancy and financial or economic variables. The AROPAj model is also capable of using data on physical variables such as livestock, production, and land. Nevertheless, a lot of AROPAj parameters are not directly sourced by raw FADN data. For example, the model makes use of other data sources, including expert reports and books, such as livestock feeding. Other sources utilized by some AROPAj modules are inter alia data concerning land use and land cover (Land Use/Cover Area frame Statistical Survey (LUCAS), CORINE Land Cover (CLC)), the European Soil Database provided by the European Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Digital Elevation Model (DEM ), and the Climate information provided by the European MARS JRC Unit. These variables are grouped by means of a clustering method to form a group of similar farms that present similar characteristics and thus can form a unit of modeling for the AROPAj model: the farm type (also denominated by farm group). The overall model is based on farm-groups, designed on a regional scale, for all of the EU. In large part, the AROPAj model originates from modeling tools aiming at CAP impact assessments. Mathematical programming models are effective in this way, especially when the implementation of new policy tools in economic models has to rely on non-time dependent data, unlike time-inferred econometric models. Due to the wide and complex diversity of CAP tools renewed throughout decades, the CAP block size quickly increased. The generic modeling approach embraces the wide variety of European farming systems which are subsumed by the continually-growing EU. It involves a multi-scale analysis from the farm type level to the EU level, accounting for realistic discontinuities at the farm level. The model is also designed to assess global change impacts and analyze policy while accounting for the complexity of interactions between agriculture and the environment. In this regard, it is a tool used for the analysis of a large range of economic and environmental domains, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and abatement, nitrogen sourced pollutions, biomass provision from perennial crops, ozone impacts and adaptation to climate change. Other collateral outputs may exist when providing farm-based estimates and data related to physical parameters. The interest of linking the AROPAj economic model with biophysical models relies on the possibility of accounting for environmental (physical impacts such as soil and climate) and technical variable impacts on the production functions, as well as on the agricultural system output relevant to environmental concerns. The general goal is to bring to light the relationship between crop production inputs (e.g. fertilizer applications) and crop production outputs (e.g. yields). The potential relation between the economic and biophysical models is to be found in the management practices of the farmer, such as irrigation, application of pesticides, and fertilizer. Some refinements are required when the farm group’s optimal solution is made of non-marketed crop output (or of non-marketed nitrogen input). In other words, this occurs when, at the optimum, the crop production is entirely re-used on-farm (e.g. for livestock feeding), or when no N -input comes from the market (e.g. manure sourced). In this case, market prices have to be replaced by relevant shadow prices, which are part of the optimal solution. In practice, the problem is solved by iterated AROPAj runs with shadow prices replacing the prices used at the previous iteration for the yield function derivative. This process of convergence is fast in most AROPAj LP’s, except for a few cases where solutions have periodic forms over iterations, with slight amplitudes. The model is running using the GNU software and applications, except for the marketed optimization solving tool (GAMS). Year after year, the choice has been made to promote the use of GNU software for AROPAj improvement, not only regarding the financial cost, but mainly to facilitate the maintenance and the evolution of our programs and applications. The model also produces some interesting spatially disaggregated outputs in line with multi-scale environmental problems. The computing and algorithm facilities embedded in the modeling process allow new improvements and new model exploitation exercises. The European agro-economic AROPAj model is built of a set of linear programming models, aiming at a good representation of European farming systems in term of geography and farm type diversity as well. As a result, the model aims at being a tool and a reference, which benefits a significant numbers of PhDs and MSc students, and contributes to many published peer-reviewed papers (to which this document refers).},

	abstract = {The loss of biodiversity has become a major concern in the 21 st century. The current agricultural model is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss; however, agriculture can also help maintain and even promote biodiversity. Therefore, understanding of the positive and negative effects of agricultural practices on biodiversity needs to be increased. We developed a method to summarize the results of meta-analyses on this subject. We reviewed 27 meta-analyses from the literature to provide a detailed overview of their results and quality. These meta-analyses examined effects of several agricultural practices on terrestrial biodiversity at the local scale: inorganic or organic fertilization, crop rotation, intercropping, use of cover crops, use of plant-protection products, tillage, landscape management and grazing. We found that (i) the meta-analyses considered certain taxonomic or functional groups much more than others, depending on the agricultural practices considered and feasibility criteria; (ii) compositional biodiversity, especially at the species level, was usually considered through changes in abundance, richness or diversity; (iii) the taxonomic/functional groups and metrics chosen determined the biodiversity observed and (iv) all of the agricultural practices studied influence biodiversity dynamics, and some have a dominant influence, such as the use of plant-protection products and landscape management. However, the intensity of practices, interactions between practices and the sensitivity of environments influenced the effects observed and must be better understood to classify practices objectively according to their effects on biodiversity. Further research and data are required to qualify in more detail the relations between agricultural practices and biodiversity, as well as to increase understanding of the relations between ecosystem functioning and the compositional and structural components of biodiversity.},

The focus of this study was contrasting non-conventional, certified products with identical products obtained through conventional production schemes (REF, henceforth) using WF as a measure of their pressure on water resources. The aim was to the show whether products that are certified as Food Quality Schemes (FQS, henceforth) could also incorporate the lower impact on water among their quality features. To perform this comparison, we analysed 23 products selected among Organic, PDO and PGI as FQS, and their conventional counterparts. By restricting the domain of analysis to the on-farm phase of the production chain, we obtained that that no significant differences emerged between the FQS and REF products. However, if the impact is measured per unit area rather than per unit product, FQS showed a significant reduction in water demand.},

	url = {https://theses.fr/2022UBFCG003},
	abstract = {Cette thèse comprend trois articles concernant l'agriculture biologique, à savoir ses déterminants et son efficacité. Le succès d'une politique est le résultat de dynamiques provenant des territoires et des agriculteurs eux-mêmes. Le chapitre 1 étudie les principaux déterminants de l'adoption à l'agriculture biologique, et en particulier les effets de pairs. En utilisant des données du Recensement Parcellaire Graphique en France, je montre d'abord combien il est important d'utiliser des données au niveau de la parcelle pour comprendre ces effets. En particulier, je trouve que l'utilisation de données au niveau de la municipalité sur la localisation du siège social sera associée à des erreurs de mesure significatives car plus de 30 \% des parcelles sont situées dans une municipalité différente de celle de leur siège social. Ensuite, je combine les données parcellaires avec le Recensement agricole et d'autres données spatiales pour montrer que les effets de pairs jouent un rôle essentiel. Un agriculteur est plus susceptible de se convertir à l'agriculture biologique en 2018 si une part plus importante de ses cinq voisins les plus proches sont des agriculteurs biologiques, et encore plus si ces pairs sont situés en amont par rapport à la direction des vents dominants. Le chapitre 2, co-écrit avec Sylvain Chabé-Ferret, Arnaud Renaud et Eva Tène, fournit des estimations à grande échelle de l'impact causal de l'agriculture biologique sur la qualité de l'eau, la biodiversité et sur les profits et la productivité des agriculteurs en utilisant la forte augmentation des surfaces cultivées en agriculture biologique qui s'est produite en France après 2000 suite à une augmentation massive des subventions pour la conversion à l'agriculture biologique. Nous tirons parti du regroupement spatial de la conversion à l'agriculture biologique dans un cadre de différences dans les différences, modifié pour prendre en compte les effets de débordement le long des cours d'eau. En appliquant notre estimateur à des données provenant de 2 800 stations de surveillance avec plus de 400 000 observations sur la qualité de l'eau, nous constatons que l'agriculture biologique réduit les concentrations de nitrates dans l'eau jusqu'à 1,3 mg/l, soit une diminution de 8 \%. Nous constatons néanmoins que l'agriculture biologique ne parvient pas à accroître la biodiversité et à réduire l'eutrophisation, car elle ne limite pas les émissions de phosphore. Nous constatons que les rendements diminuent de 33 \% après la conversion à l'agriculture biologique, ce qui implique que la surface agricole doit s'étendre de 50 \% pour que l'agriculture biologique produise la même quantité de nourriture que l'agriculture conventionnelle. Dans l'ensemble, comme les produits biologiques se vendent à un prix plus élevé et que les dépenses en intrants synthétiques diminuent, la conversion à l'agriculture biologique augmente les bénéfices des exploitations. Le chapitre 3, co-écrit avec Rachel Guillain et Sophie Legras, étudie le biais de perception des pratiques agricoles et la manière dont l'agriculture biologique apporte un signal supplémentaire. Nous évaluons la disposition à payer pour la proximité des terres agricoles en utilisant des données inédites sur les prix des logements en France, couplées à des données sur l'utilisation des terres.  L'objectif de ce chapitre est double. Premièrement, il vise à déterminer l'étendue spatiale des avantages dérivés de la proximité d'une parcelle agricole et de meilleures pratiques agro-environnementales. Deuxièmement, en fusionnant les transactions immobilières avec des données agricoles géoréférencées, nous sommes en mesure d'isoler l'aspect informationnel du label biologique.},

	abstract = {Organic farming practices have been promoted as, inter alia, reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. This meta-analysis systematically analyses published studies that compare environmental impacts of organic and conventional farming in Europe. The results show that organic farming practices generally have positive impacts on the environment per unit of area, but not necessarily per product unit. Organic farms tend to have higher soil organic matter content and lower nutrient losses (nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia emissions) per unit of field area. However, ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems. Organic systems had lower energy requirements, but higher land use, eutrophication potential and acidification potential per product unit. The variation within the results across different studies was wide due to differences in the systems compared and research methods used. The only impacts that were found to differ significantly between the systems were soil organic matter content, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions per unit of field area, energy use and land use. Most of the studies that compared biodiversity in organic and conventional farming demonstrated lower environmental impacts from organic farming. The key challenges in conventional farming are to improve soil quality (by versatile crop rotations and additions of organic material), recycle nutrients and enhance and protect biodiversity. In organic farming, the main challenges are to improve the nutrient management and increase yields. In order to reduce the environmental impacts of farming in Europe, research efforts and policies should be targeted to developing farming systems that produce high yields with low negative environmental impacts drawing on techniques from both organic and conventional systems.},

	abstract = {Aim The effects of land use and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on plant species richness are typically studied in isolation. Here, we quantified the combined effects of these two pressures on terrestrial plant species richness at a 0.25º spatial resolution across the globe. Location Global. Methods We first used local monitoring and experimental data to determine the proportional changes in plant species richness in relation to different land-use types and N addition levels according to a meta-analytical approach. We then developed a new multi-pressure species–area relationship (mp-SAR) model to combine the site-level responses resulting from the meta-analyses with global land use and N deposition maps to calculate changes in plant species richness at a resolution of 0.25º across the globe. Results Both pressures combined resulted in an average plant species richness decline of 26\% (± 12\% SD) across the grid cells. The combined impact was the largest in Europe, with an average decline of 34\% (± 8\%), and the smallest in South America (16\% ± 11\%). Overall, species declines due to land use were considerably larger (19\% ± 11\%) than declines due to N deposition (6\% ± 6\%). Main conclusions Our new species–area model allows for systematic large-scale assessments of the combined effects of multiple pressures on species richness based on easily retrievable input data. Overall, land use is a more important driver of plant species richness decline than N deposition, but N deposition may have considerable additional impact in specific regions of Europe, Asia and North America. These findings imply that conservation efforts should simultaneously tackle both pressures to ensure their effectiveness in preserving plant biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

	abstract = {We discuss comparative static partial equilibrium approaches for large-scale monetary valuations of animal-mediated crop pollination. These approaches rely upon reported crop production values, own-price elasticities of demand and experimentally found dependence ratios that express crop-specific yield shares due to pollinators. We dismiss the established long-term approach given the difficulty of anticipating the adaptation of the bioeconomic system to changes of pollinator abundance. Instead, we suggest another more parsimonious method, which assesses the short-term welfare effects following a sudden change in pollinator abundance. Using 2016-2018 data on agricultural production, we estimate the worldwide welfare effects due to a pollinator collapse for a range of plausible own-price elasticities, both from short-term and long-term perspectives. For the former we also simulate a global recovery scenario. Depending on the overall price elasticity assumed, the short-term effects of a total pollinator loss lie between 1 and 2 \% of global GDP. We also apply the different valuation approaches to more detailed German 2006-2016 crop production data, where we account for crop-specific demand. As the reported dependence ratios vary in wide ranges, we rely upon stochastic simulations to obtain likely distributions of the German welfare effects.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity offsets are seen as a policy mechanism to balance development and conservation goals. Many offset schemes employ habitat restoration in one area to recreate biodiversity value that is destroyed elsewhere, assuming that recovery is timely and predictable. Recent research has challenged these assumptions on the grounds that restoration implies long time delays and a low certainty of success. To investigate these assertions, and to assess the strength of empirical support for offset policy, we used a meta-analytic approach to analyze data from 108 comparative studies of secondary growth (SG) and old-growth (OG) habitat (a total of 1228 SG sites and 716 OG reference sites). We extracted species checklists and calculated standardized response ratios for species richness, Fisher's alpha, Sorenson similarity, and Morisita-Horn similarity. We modeled diversity change with habitat age using generalized linear models and multi-model averaging, correcting for a number of potential explanatory variables. We tested whether (1) diversity of passively and actively restored habitat converges to OG values over time, (2) active restoration significantly accelerates this process, and (3) current offset policies are appropriate to the predicted uncertainties and time lags associated with restoration. The results indicate that in the best case, species richness converges to OG reference values within a century, species similarity (Sorenson) takes about twice as long, and assemblage composition (Morisita-Horn) up to an order of magnitude longer (hundreds to thousands of years). Active restoration significantly accelerates the process for all indices, but the inherently large time lags, uncertainty, and risk of restoration failure require offset ratios that far exceed what is currently applied in practice. Restoration offset policy therefore leads to a net loss of biodiversity, and represents an inappropriate use of the otherwise valuable tool of ecosystem restoration.},

Effect sizes were 17 times smaller on average than those found in comparable laboratory studies. The most effective nutrition label, Nutri-Score, increased the purchases of foods in the top third of their category nutrition-wise by 14\%, but had no impact on the purchases of foods with medium, low, or unlabeled nutrition quality. Therefore, Nutri-Score only improved the nutritional quality of the basket of labeled foods purchased by 2.5\% (−0.142 FSA points). Nutri-Score’s performance improved with the variance (but not the mean) of the nutritional quality of the category. In-store surveys suggest that Nutri-Score’s ability to attract attention and help shoppers rank products by nutritional quality may explain its performance.},

	abstract = {Agriculture today places great strains on biodiversity, soils, water and the atmosphere, and these strains will be exacerbated if current trends in population growth, meat and energy consumption, and food waste continue. Thus, farming systems that are both highly productive and minimize environmental harms are critically needed. How organic agriculture may contribute to world food production has been subject to vigorous debate over the past decade. Here, we revisit this topic comparing organic and conventional yields with a new meta-dataset three times larger than previously used (115 studies containing more than 1000 observations) and a new hierarchical analytical framework that can better account for the heterogeneity and structure in the data. We find organic yields are only 19.2\% (±3.7\%) lower than conventional yields, a smaller yield gap than previous estimates. More importantly, we find entirely different effects of crop types and management practices on the yield gap compared with previous studies. For example, we found no significant differences in yields for leguminous versus non-leguminous crops, perennials versus annuals or developed versus developing countries. Instead, we found the novel result that two agricultural diversification practices, multi-cropping and crop rotations, substantially reduce the yield gap (to 9 ± 4\% and 8 ± 5\%, respectively) when the methods were applied in only organic systems. These promising results, based on robust analysis of a larger meta-dataset, suggest that appropriate investment in agroecological research to improve organic management systems could greatly reduce or eliminate the yield gap for some crops or regions.},

	abstract = {Facing irreversible impacts on ecosystems as well as economic losses, EU authorities now try to promote environmentally friendlier agricultural production techniques. However, without a global environmental assessment, there is a risk of picking technologies that result in displacing part of the environmental problems abroad. In particular, should environmentally friendlier techniques result in a lower output per hectare in the EU, market driven effects might generate incentives to produce more intensively in other parts of the world, including in high natural value areas. We illustrate these possible effects by considering a partial, but significant, shift of EU agriculture to organic production. We attempt to gauge the extent in which local environmental benefits are offset by indirect ones in third countries using a variety of criteria. We use a specific version of a dynamic general equilibrium model with an improved representation of land use. We introduce a formal representation of organic production and a specific demand structure for organic products. The modeling of organic technology is grounded in micro data, which suggest that yields in EU organic production are still lower than those of conventional crops. We find that if 20\% of EU land devoted to arable crops is converted to organic as planned by some member states, significant production displacements will take place unless the yield gap is reduced. The negative indirect effects on the environment appear limited compared to the local benefits of adopting greener forms of agriculture in the EU. However, in the case of greenhouse gases, the indirect emissions more than offset the local benefits of organic agriculture. Balancing direct and indirect effects is difficult, but in the case of chemical pollution as well as biodiversity, our results show that indirect effects are large enough to deserve being accounted for in Life Cycle Analyses.},

Furthermore, this environment allowing users to easily incorporate other R packages to form a seamless chain of functions to undertake more complex pre or post image processing and analysis. The package computes 15 phenological metrics based on satellite-based NDVI measurements over the season which can be easily visualised and used for successive spatio-temporal analysis. The metrics are theoretically related to Zadoks growth stages which explicitly characterise cereal crop growth conditions, including new leaf emergence, flowering, ripening, and yield. These metrics provide a systematic understanding of characterisation of the plant-soil-climate interactions. We present examples that illustrate the utility of our package in a Southern Australian broad-acre, rain-fed cereal cropping region.},

Various legislative and other initiatives have been introduced or proposed to use trade policy measures to support the move to higher sustainability standards in the food system both in the EU and globally. Mandatory due diligence requirements for companies are proposed to ensure they have ‘clean’ supply chains. Mirror clauses have been proposed in agri-food trade to require that imported products meet similar regulatory standards as EU producers. Promoting this agenda is a priority of the French EU Presidency in the first half of 2022. Higher sustainability standards and accompanying trade measures will have a significant impact on the competitiveness of EU producers as well as international trade in food. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of this debate, with a particular focus on vulnerable developing countries for which the EU is an important market},

	abstract = {A substantial proportion of the global land surface is used for agricultural production. Agricultural land serves multiple societal purposes; it provides food, fuel and fibre and also acts as habitat for organisms and supports the services they provide. Biodiversity conservation and food production need to be balanced: production needs to be sustainable, while conservation cannot be totally at the expense of crop yield. To identify the benefits (in terms of biodiversity conservation) and costs (in terms of reduction in yields) of agricultural management, we examined the relationship between crop yield and abundance and species density of important taxa in winter cereal fields on both organic and conventional farms in lowland England. Of eight species groups examined, five (farmland plants, bumblebees, butterflies, solitary bees and epigeal arthropods) were negatively associated with crop yield, but the shape of this relationship varied between taxa. It was linear for the abundance of bumblebees and species density of butterflies, concave up for the abundance of epigeal arthropods and butterflies and concave down for species density of plants and bumblebees. Grain production per unit area was 54\% lower in organic compared with conventional fields. When controlling for yield, diversity of bumblebees, butterflies, hoverflies and epigeal arthropods did not differ between farming systems, indicating that observed differences in biodiversity between organic and conventional fields are explained by lower yields in organic fields and not by different management practices per se. Only percentage cover and species density of plants were increased by organic field management after controlling for yield. The abundance of solitary wild bees and hoverflies was increased in landscapes with high amount of organic land. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that considerable gains in biodiversity require roughly proportionate reductions in yield in highly productive agricultural systems. They suggest that conservation efforts may be more cost effective in low-productivity agricultural systems or on non-agricultural land. In less productive agricultural landscapes, biodiversity benefit can be gained by concentrating organic farms into hotspots without a commensurate reduction in yield.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal “active principle” and “other ingredients,” with the latter collectively also known as “adjuvants.” These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cocktail effects and synergistic interactions of chemicals in mixtures are an area of great concern to both the public and regulatory authorities. The main concern is whether some chemicals can enhance the effect of other chemicals, so that they jointly exert a larger effect than predicted. This phenomenon is called synergy. Here we present a review of the scientific literature on three main groups of environmentally relevant chemical toxicants: pesticides, metal ions and antifouling compounds. The aim of the review is to determine 1) the frequency of synergy, 2) the extent of synergy, 3) whether any particular groups or classes of chemicals tend to induce synergy, and 4) which physiological mechanisms might be responsible for this synergy. Synergy is here defined as mixtures with minimum two-fold difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations using Concentration Addition (CA) as a reference model and including both lethal and sub-lethal endpoints. The results showed that synergy occurred in 7\%, 3\% and 26\% of the 194, 21 and 136 binary pesticide, metal and antifoulants mixtures included in the data compilation on frequency. The difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations was rarely more than 10-fold. For pesticides, synergistic mixtures included cholinesterase inhibitors or azole fungicides in 95\% of 69 described cases. Both groups of pesticides are known to interfere with metabolic degradation of other xenobiotics. For the four synergistic metal and 47 synergistic antifoulant mixtures the pattern in terms of chemical groups inducing synergy was less clear. Hypotheses in terms of mechanisms governing these interactions are discussed. It was concluded that true synergistic interactions between chemicals are rare and often occur at high concentrations. Addressing the cumulative rather than synergistic effect of co-occurring chemicals, using standard models as CA, is therefore regarded as the most important step in the risk assessment of chemical cocktails.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Obesity and diabetes have reached epidemic proportions the past few decades and continue to progress worldwide with no clear sign of decline of the epidemic. Obesity is of high concern because it is the main risk factor for a number of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic diseases constitute a major challenge as they are associated with an overall reduced quality of life and impose a heavy economic burden on countries. These are multifactorial diseases and it is now recognized that environmental exposure to man-made chemical pollutants is part of the equation. Yet, risk assessment procedures are based on a one-by-one chemical evaluation which does not meet the specificities of the multi-exposure scenario of life, e.g., a combined and long-term exposure to even the smallest amounts of chemicals. Indeed, it is assumed that environmental exposure to chemicals will be negligible based on the low potency of each chemical and that they do not interact. Within this mini-review, strong evidences are brought that exposure to low levels of multiple chemicals especially those shown to interfere with hormonal action, the so-called endocrine disrupting compounds do trigger metabolic disturbances in conditions in which no effect was expected if considering the concentration of each individual chemical in the mixture. This is known as the cocktail effect. It means that risk assessment procedures are not protective enough and thus that it should be revisited for the sake of Public Health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While we are rapidly gaining an understanding of how individual contaminants affect communities, communities are exposed to suites of contaminants yet investigations of the effects of diverse contaminant mixtures in aquatic communities are rare. I examined how a single application of five insecticides (malathion, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and endosulfan) and five herbicides (glyphosate, atrazine, acetochlor, metolachlor, and 2,4-D) at low concentrations (2–16 p.p.b.) affected aquatic communities composed of zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, and larval amphibians (gray tree frogs, Hyla versicolor, and leopard frogs, Rana pipiens). Using outdoor mesocosms, I examined each pesticide alone, a mix of insecticides, a mix of herbicides, and a mix of all ten pesticides. Individual pesticides had a wide range of direct and indirect effects on all trophic groups. For some taxa (i.e., zooplankton and algae), the impact of pesticide mixtures could largely be predicted from the impacts of individual pesticides; for other taxa (i.e., amphibians) it could not. For amphibians, there was an apparent direct toxic effect of endosulfan that caused 84\% mortality of leopard frogs and an indirect effect induced by diazinon that caused 24\% mortality of leopard frogs. When pesticides were combined, the mix of herbicides had no negative effects on the survival and metamorphosis of amphibians, but the mix of insecticides and the mix of all ten pesticides eliminated 99\% of leopard frogs. Interestingly, these mixtures did not cause mortality in the gray tree frogs and, as a result, the gray tree frogs grew nearly twice as large due to reduced competition with leopard frogs. In short, wetland communities can be dramatically impacted by low concentrations of pesticides (both separate and combined) and these results offer important insights for the conservation of wetland communities.},

As the modes of action for pesticides are not species-specific, concerns have been raised about environmental risks associated with their exposure through various routes (e.g., residues in food and drinking water). Although such hazards range from short-term (e.g., skin and eye irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea) to chronic impacts (e.g., cancer, asthma, and diabetes), their risks are difficult to elucidate due to the involvement of various factors (e.g., period and level of exposure, type of pesticide (regarding toxicity and persistence), and the environmental characteristics of the affected areas). There are no groups in the human population that are completely unexposed to pesticides while most diseases are multi-causal to add considerable complexity to public health assessments. Hence, development of eco-friendly pesticide alternatives (e.g., EcoSMART) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques is desirable to reduce the impacts of pesticides. This paper was hence organized to present a comprehensive review on pesticides with respect to their types, environmental distribution, routes of exposure, and health impacts.},

An increase in organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5\% to 20\% enhanced bee species richness in fallow strips by 50\%, density of solitary bees by 60\% and bumble bee density by 150\%. Bee species richness and bumble bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale. It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields. We conclude that the incorporation of organic crop fields into conventionally managed agricultural landscapes can provide food resources needed to sustain greater pollinator species richness in noncrop habitats.},

	abstract = {Dry semi-natural grasslands are highly species-rich, and therefore often protected in cultural landscapes of Central Europe. However, reserves are typically small and may be subjected to edge effects. Here, we ask how grassland biodiversity changes from edges neighbouring arable fields into grassland interior. We compared plant diversity of protected grasslands adjacent to organically versus conventionally managed arable fields. We surveyed the vegetation along 50 m transects from the arable field border into the grasslands, and compared site characteristics via Ellenberg indicator values and measured soil parameters. Averaged linear mixed-effects models showed an increase of diversity with increasing distance from the adjacent field, from a mean observed richness of 25 species per 4 m²-plot at the border to more than 30 species in the interior. For organic sites, models consistently showed 13 species more per plot than for conventional sites. Diversity for the two land use types remained different over the entire transect length. Thus, the effect of adjacent field farming extends far into the interior of the protected grasslands, yet overall organic farming is less detrimental. We assume that this is related to a combination of differences in local farm management, such as pesticide application, and the wider landscape context associated with the farm type. Buffer zones with at least organic-like management could improve the conservation value of nature reserves.},

The aim of the present work was therefore to investigate the magnitude of including these impact categories within a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of organic and conventional dairy systems differing in basic production conditions. Three basic systems representative of a range of European approaches to dairy production were selected for the analysis, i.e. (i) low-land mixed crop-livestock systems, (ii) lowland grassland-based systems, (iii) and mountainous systems. As in previous publications, this study showed that when assessing climate change, eutrophication and acidification impact organic milk has similar or slightly lower impact than conventional, although land-use is higher under organic management. Including soil carbon changes reduced the global warming potential by 5–18\%, mostly in organic systems with a high share of grass in the ration. The impacts of organic milk production on freshwater ecotoxicity, biodiversity and resource depletion were 2, 33 and 20\% of the impacts of conventional management, respectively, across the basic systems considered. The study highlights the importance of including biodiversity, ecotoxicity and soil carbon changes in life cycle assessments when comparing organic and conventional agricultural products. Furthermore, the study shows that including more grass in the ration of dairy cows increases soil carbon sequestration and decreases the negative impact on biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Although positive effects on biodiversity of woody features in agricultural landscapes are widely recognized, questions remain as to which landscape context to prioritize their implementation and in what proportion. To investigate the response of farmland biodiversity to small woody features (SWF) density in different landscape compositions (cropland, grassland, mixed), we analyzed fine-resolution data from standardized monitoring schemes on 111 birds, 22 bats, and 25 bush cricket's species, at national scale (relying on 3772, 834 and 727 monitoring points) over the period 2015–2019, in metropolitan France. We used Generalized Additive Mixed Models to analyze population and community responses, through different metrics (abundance, species diversity, and functional composition). We found a positive response exhibited by the three taxa to SWF, more especially in cropland where the SWF density is the lowest relative to grassland and mixed landscapes. Also, our results suggested a non-linear response common to the three taxa, with an increased benefit up to at least 6 \% of SWF density in cropland, and beyond for most of the metrics but to a lesser extent (e.g., maximum abundance reached at 7–12 \% SWF). We note, however, that some species among farmland bird specialists are negatively impacted by SWF. Overall, we emphasize the benefits to promote woody features in agricultural landscapes, notably in cropland, to support biodiversity and its associated ecosystem functions. Our study provides crucial empirical evidence to the recommendations from previous studies and the relevance of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 to dedicate at least 10 \% of farmland to high-diversity landscape features.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we model the supply and demand for agricultural goods and assess and compare how welfare, land use, and biodiversity are affected under intensive and extensive farming systems at market equilibrium instead of at exogenous production levels. As long as demand is responsive to price, and intensive farming has lower production costs, there exists a rebound effect (larger market size) of intensive farming. Intensive farming is then less beneficial to biodiversity than extensive farming is, except when there is a high degree of convexity between biodiversity and yield. On the other hand, extensive farming leads to higher prices and smaller quantities for consumers. Depending on parameter values, it may increase or decrease agricultural producer profits. Implementing “active” land sparing by zoning some land for agriculture and other land for conservation could overcome the rebound effect of intensive farming, but we show that farmers have then incentives to encroach on land zoned for conservation, with higher incentives under intensive farming. We also show that the primary effect of the higher prices associated with extensive farming is a reduction of animal feed production, which has a higher price elasticity of demand, whereas less of an effect is observed on plant-based food production and almost no effect is observed on biofuel production if there are mandatory blending policies.},

To assess the persistence of pesticides in soil, a multiple-compound screening method (log Kow 1.7–5.5) was developed based on pressurized liquid extraction, QuEChERS and LC-HRMS. The method was applied to study 80 polar pesticides and {\textgreater}90 transformation products (TPs) in archived topsoil samples from the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network (NABO) from 1995 to 2008 with known pesticide application patterns. The results reveal large variations between crop type and field sites. For the majority of the sites 10–15 pesticides were identified with a detection rate of 45\% at concentrations between 1 and 330 μg/kgdw in soil. Furthermore, TPs were detected in 47\% of the cases where the “parent-compound” was applied. Overall, residues of about 80\% of all applied pesticides could be detected with half of these found as TPs with a persistence of more than a decade.},

	abstract = {There is long-running debate concerning the conservation benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) in seascapes that are already ‘well-regulated’ by other forms of fisheries management. Resolving this issue is particularly important given recent calls for expanding MPA coverage. Here, we adapt an influential model from agriculture – the land sparing/sharing framework – to an archetypal managed trawl fishery to determine how catches can be obtained at least cost to biodiversity in such seascapes. This new sea sparing/sharing framework fixes catch across scenarios so that fishing effort displacement is not overlooked. We find that a sparing strategy combining MPAs with fishing effort regulation is best for biodiversity when avoiding the local extinction of sensitive species is a priority. However, if there are no sensitive species, or if biodiversity is instead measured in a way that emphasises species abundances, then a sharing strategy relying on fishing effort regulation alone instead prevails. Extending these findings globally to ‘well-regulated’ crustacean trawl fisheries, we find that ≈72\% may benefit from no-trawl MPAs (≈57–100\% depending on the methodology chosen). However, these MPAs could also necessitate increased fishing effort if catches are to be maintained. Our framework thus suggests that whether MPAs increase biodiversity in a well-regulated seascape depends heavily on the presence of highly sensitive species there, as well as conservation and management priorities.},

This is mainly due to constraints in data availability and compatibility with LCA inventories. To target this gap, relative pollinator abundance estimates were obtained with the use of a Delphi assessment, during which 25 experts, covering 16 nationalities and 45 countries of expertise, provided scores for low, typical, and high expected abundance associated with 24 land use categories. Based on these estimates, this study presents a set of globally generic characterization factors (CFs) that allows translating land use into relative impacts to wild pollinator abundance. The associated uncertainty of the CFs is presented along with an illustrative case to demonstrate the applicability in LCA studies. The CFs based on estimates that reached consensus during the Delphi assessment are recommended as readily applicable and allow key differences among land use types to be distinguished. The resulting CFs are proposed as the first step for incorporating pollinator impacts in LCA studies, exemplifying the use of expert elicitation methods as a useful tool to fill data gaps that constrain the characterization of key environmental impacts.},

More bird species occurred in organic than in conventional fields regardless of land-use type (wheat fields and meadows). However, hedge length had a much stronger effect on bird richness than organic farmland management. We found an interaction of landscape complexity and hedge length in that hedge length enhanced bird richness only in case of simple landscapes ({\textless}17\% semi-natural areas within a 500m radius around the centre of bird survey plots). In more complex landscapes the local effect of hedge length levelled off because bird richness was high even without local hedges. Therefore, adding hedges or introducing organic farming practices should be primarily promoted in simple landscapes, where it really makes a difference for biodiversity.},

To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal ﬁeld borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were signiﬁcantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only signiﬁcantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher ﬂower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reﬂect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reﬂects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumble bee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid.},

	abstract = {Farming systems and management regimes of vineyards may affect local biodiversity of plants and invertebrates. While most studies have focused on the overall biodiversity of vineyards, there has been little consideration of the response of different ecological guilds to vineyard management, or to how vineyard management affects communities of adjacent semi-natural habitats. We study here two functional guilds of carabids and five of spiders in Langa Astigiana (NW-Italy) with the following aims: (i) to assess the comparative effects of organic and conventional farming systems, along with associated habitat and landscape variables, on species richness and abundance in vineyards; and (ii) to compare the same within forest patches surrounding organic and conventional vineyards. The different guilds exhibited distinct preferences for habitat characteristics (i.e. grass cover), landscape context and farming systems. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed that spider preferences mostly depended upon habitat variables, while carabid preferences depended on small-scale landscape variables. In general, organic farming increased biodiversity and abundance of arthropod predators, even though different guilds of carabids and spiders responded differently. Brachypterous carabids, ambush spiders, ground-hunter spiders and other hunters preferred organic vineyards, whereas macropterous carabids, specialist spiders (mostly ant-eating spiders) and sheet web weavers selected conventional vineyards. The research we report here shows that preferences for vineyards with different farming systems has been driven not only by farming systems per se (i.e. omission of synthetic pesticides), but also by habitat characteristics and small-scale landscape structure. Arthropod diversity was greater in the forest patches adjacent to organic vineyards than to conventional ones. This suggests that organic systems may sustain a higher diversity of carabids and spiders both in vineyards and in the adjacent forest patches as well. We conclude that although conventional systems may promote the diversity of some guilds, organic systems should take priority.},

These experiments are based on systems research and characterized by their focus on production methods, whole food testing and procedures in accordance with the terms of organic farming. A short review of such experiments shows that the majority of these tests revealed effects of the organically produced feed on health parameters such as reproductive performance and immune responses. Systems research is not just about simple cause–effect chains, but rather about the pluralism of interactions in biological networks; therefore, the interpretation of the outcome of whole food experiments is difficult. Furthermore, the test diets of organic and conventional origin can be constituted in different ways, compensating for or maintaining existing differences in nutrient and energy contents. The science-based results suggest positive influences from organic feeds, but there is still a need for confirmation in animals and, finally, in humans. For this purpose animal feeding trials with feed from different production systems should be conducted, with the aims to define health indicators and to establish biomarkers as a basis for future dietary intervention studies in humans.

	abstract = {Although the nutritional composition of organic food has been thoroughly researched, there is a dearth of published data relating to its impact on human health.This systematic review aimed to examine the association between organic food intake and health effects, including changes in in vivo biomarkers, disease prevalence, and functional changes.PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception through Nov 13, 2022.Both observational and interventional studies conducted in human populations were included, and association between level of organic food intake and each outcome was quantified as “no association,” “inconsistent,” “beneficial correlation/harmful correlation,” or “insufficient”. For outcomes with sufficient data reported by at least 3 studies, meta-analyses were conducted, using random-effects models to calculate standardized mean differences.Based on the included 23 observational and 27 interventional studies, the association between levels of organic food intake and (i) pesticide exposure biomarker was assessed as “beneficial correlation,” (ii) toxic metals and carotenoids in the plasma was assessed as “no association,” (iii) fatty acids in human milk was assessed as “insufficient,” (iv) phenolics was assessed as “beneficial”, and serum parameters and antioxidant status was assessed as “inconsistent”. For diseases and functional changes, there was an overall “beneficial” association with organic food intake, and there were similar findings for obesity and body mass index. However, evidence for association of organic food intake with other single diseases was assessed as “insufficient” due to the limited number and extent of studies.Organic food intake was found to have a beneficial impact in terms of reducing pesticide exposure, and the general effect on disease and functional changes (body mass index, male sperm quality) was appreciable. More long-term studies are required, especially for single diseases.PROSPERO registration no. CRD42022350175.},
